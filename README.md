## Getting Started
# For backend
Make sure you have the appropriate packages installed for the Django server by doing the following:
```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the servers for dev environment
First, run the Next.js development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Then, in a seperate terminal, run the Django server in order to have the backend connection:

```bash
cd backend
python manage.py runserver
```

The Django connection will be on [http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/)

## When new packages are installed in Django, update the package dependencies by the following:
```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

## Rest of Next.js project README documentation

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
